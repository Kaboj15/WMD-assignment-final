                                    Held at the Hippodrome de Longchamp to the west of Paris, the Arc de Triomphe Horse Race is one of the most prestigious racing events in Europe. With €5million in prize money, the event has been a holy grail for the world’s premier jockeys since its inauguration in 1920. Don’t fancy dolling up? Fortunately for you, the dress code is ‘laissez-faire’.

Paris Pride, or the Marche des Fiertés, is one of the world’s biggest and best celebrations of its sort. The carnival procession is joyous, there’s an ace concert line-up, and hundreds and hundreds of thousands turn up to march in defence of equal rights for the LGBTQ+ community each year. As the evening draws in, the party continues at clubs and bars throughout the capital

                        Paris can still claim to be the world’s style capital, with aficionados flocking en masse to its annual fashion weeks. For celeb spotting, head to runway sites like the Grand Palais or the Espace Eiffel. Wear your best vintage around the Tuileries and a street-style photographer may even stop you for a snap

The Versailles Masquerade Ball is truly unforgettable. Held in the magnificent Palace of Versailles grounds, the ball’s dress code is full baroque costume – including masks. Marie Antoinette-style dresses and 18th-century gentlemen’s attire are available for rent or purchase from specialist outlets throughout Versailles.

                        French cuisine is good. Very good. In fact, in 2010, Unesco enshrined it as part of the ‘intangible cultural heritage of humanity’. Since then, this three-day festival has celebrated all things French food, with hundreds of banquets, tastings, workshops and special market days taking place across Paris.

When? August

It’s all in the name. Radiohead, Foo Fighters, System of a Down, Nine Inch Nails… this festival does rock music and it does it loud. These days, however, the heavyweight rock acts brush shoulders with an array of hip-hop and electronic acts from France and further afield. The festival’s five stages are set in the beautiful surrounds of the Parc de Saint-Cloud.

                        You all know this one. On July 14 France marks the storming of the Bastille prison – a turning point in the French Revolution. In the morning crowds gather to watch a military parade along the Champs-Élysées. Come evening, the Champ de Mars throngs with up to a million spectators as fireworks are set off from the base of the Eiffel Tower.

                        The streets of Paris come alive with the sound of music every June as free parties and concerts ring in the summer solstice throughout the city. The Institut du Monde Arabe, the Louvre and Place Denfert-Rochereau are among the best party spots – though we recommend simply wandering.
